QuickDBD was used to create the ER diagram, applying primary/foreign keys, and 1-to-1 and 1-to-many relationships.
Exported png image of diagram and sql code to generate tables in PostgreSQL pgAdmin4.
Design includes junction tables to handle many-to-many relationships, converting them to one-to-many or one-to-one relationships.
Data for tables was imported from .csv files (see Data folder).
Datatypes were updated in SQL script generated from QuickDBD before running script to create tables.
